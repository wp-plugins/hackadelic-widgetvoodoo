* Minor fixes/improvements

#### [1.0.6]

Fixes an issue with the tag cloud widget.

#### [1.0.2](http://hackadelic.com/widget-voodoo-1-0-2-releasewidget-voodoo-1-0-2-release)

Fixes the widget body wrapping strategy to avoid a problem with the tag cloud widget (and probably with others, too).

Also, a rectification of the CSS class assignment will require a minor change in your CSS clauses.
The [the plug-in homepage](http://hackadelic.com/solutions/wordpress/widgetvoodoo "Hackadelic Widget Voodoo") has been updated to reflect the new CSS structure. See [the details in the release announcement post](http://hackadelic.com/widget-voodoo-1-0-2-release).

#### 1.0.1

Refrains from wrapping widgets bodies that are already wrapped in a single element (and reuses that element instead) to avoid some formatting problems reported by [Saintneko](http://hackadelic.com/solutions/wordpress/widgetvoodoo#comment-307).
